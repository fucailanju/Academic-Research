# Academic Research

Welcome to my academic research profile. I upload all kinds of analytical reports, published papers, and packages in this repository. Please come back often to check things up!

I am currently a PhD candidate at Penn State, pursuing my dual-title PhD in political science and social data analytics. I identify myself as a math and quant guy. My research agenda is focused on causal inference in high-dimensional/social network data. I support this agenda with trainings on ML, AI, CS, SNA, CI, SS, GT, and SEM. 

I would really appreciate it if you find my research ideas and mindsets interesting. And I welcome all kinds of constructive discussions on acadmeic research, because I believe learning is a life-time thing to do. Cheers!
